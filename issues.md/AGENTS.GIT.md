# AGENTS.GIT.md

## Scope

Git and GitHub conventions for this repository. Use these rules whenever you create branches, commit, or open pull requests. Process-oriented steps (planning, test sequencing, etc.) remain in `NOTES.md`; this document focuses purely on version control hygiene.

## Branch Strategy

- `master` is the only production branch; there is no `main`.
- Work proceeds as a forward-only chain: branch from the latest issue branch rather than repeatedly branching off `master`, so history forms a linear sequence of completed issues.
- Only fast-forward or merge commits that advance history are allowed. Never rewrite or reset existing commits.

## Branch Naming

- Create a branch before editing files. Use the taxonomy prefixes `feature/`, `improvement/`, `bugfix/`, `maintenance/`, or `blocked/`.
- Follow the pattern `<prefix>/<ISSUE-ID>-short-description`, e.g., `bugfix/GN-58-editor-duplicate-preview`.
- Keep names concise enough for GitHub limits while remaining descriptive.
- Reserve `blocked/<issue-id>` branches for work that cannot progress; the blocking reason must be documented in `ISSUES.md`.

## Commits & History

- Each issue typically concludes with a single commit capturing the tests and implementation for that issue. If additional fixes are needed, append new commits—do not amend or reorder history.
- Never use `git push --force`, `git rebase`, or `git cherry-pick`. History is append-only.
- If a mistake occurs, fix it with a new commit on top of the existing branch.
- Commit messages must be descriptive (e.g., “Fix GN-58 editor preview duplication”) so reviewers understand the change at a glance.
- Do not commit or push changes unless the relevant tests, linters, and formatters have been run and are passing on the current branch, as required by `AGENTS.md` and the process guidance in `NOTES.md` (blocked work must be explicitly documented in `ISSUES.md`).

## Tracking & Remotes

- Push only to the `origin` remote.
- First push for a branch must be `git push -u origin <branch>` to establish tracking; subsequent pushes use `git push`.
- Do not rename remote branches or create alternate remotes for the same work.
- Keep local branches aligned with their tracked remote counterpart; fetch/rebase equivalents are prohibited, so merge the tracked branch if needed to resolve conflicts.

## Pull Requests & GitHub

- When a branch is ready, open a pull request via the GitHub CLI (`gh pr create`). Reserve the GitHub UI only for viewing existing PRs or reviews.
- PRs are chained: target the previously opened issue branch so reviewers can follow the sequential history. Only the first PR in a sequence targets `master`.
- PR descriptions should reference the issue ID, summarize the change, and include PLAN.md content if required by process docs.
- Keep PRs scoped to a single issue branch. If multiple issues are in flight, each must have its own branch and PR.
- Continuous Integration (CI) runs on GitHub Actions; rely on it for acceptance tests and release validation. Local checks remain mandatory, but CI is the authoritative gate before merge.
- Releases and deployment artifacts originate from GitHub workflows; keep branch histories clean to ensure deterministic CI results.

## File Tracking & Ignore Rules

- `PLAN.md` is intentionally ignored in `.gitignore`; ensure it never appears in commits. If it does, remove it with `git filter-repo --path PLAN.md --invert-paths` before proceeding.
- Treat generated artifacts (build output, coverage reports, etc.) as untracked unless explicitly added to `.gitignore`.

## Conflict Resolution

- Resolve merge conflicts locally by editing files and committing the resolution; never use force pushes or rebases to “fix” conflicts.
- If conflicts arise because an earlier branch landed upstream, merge the updated upstream branch into your branch and continue forward.

## Blocking Branches

- After three documented attempts on a branch without resolution, convert the branch to `blocked/<issue-id>`, commit the current state, push it, and document the status in `ISSUES.md`.
- Future work resumes from the last successful (non-blocked) branch tip.

## Command Examples

Use these standard commands when working with Git and GitHub in this repo:

```sh
# Start from the latest branch tip
git checkout bugfix/GN-57-editor-spam
git checkout -b bugfix/GN-58-editor-preview

# Stage and commit work
git add path/to/files
git commit -m "Fix GN-58 editor preview duplication"

# Push and open a PR
git push -u origin bugfix/GN-58-editor-preview
gh pr create --base master --head bugfix/GN-58-editor-preview --fill
```

CI builds and release artifacts are produced by GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`. Refer to those YAML files for additional build examples and replicate the same steps locally when needed.
