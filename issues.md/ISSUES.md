# ISSUES (Append-only section-based log)

Entries record newly discovered requests or changes, with their outcomes. No instructive content lives here. Read @NOTES.md for the process to follow when fixing issues.

Read @AGENTS.md, @README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md. Read @POLICY.md, @NOTES.md, and @ISSUES.md under issues.md/folder. Start working on open issues. Prioritize bugfixes and maintenance. Work autonomously and stack up PRs. 

Each issue is formatted as `- [ ] [UT-<number>]`. When resolved it becomes `- [x] [UT-<number>]`.

- [ ] [UT-300] Close response body when transport returns both response and error.

The error path after httpClient.Do returns immediately without closing the response body when Do returns both a response and an error. Per net/http this can happen for protocol errors or cancellations, and the caller must still close Response.Body; skipping it leaks the underlying connection and prevents keep-alives. Consider closing httpResponse.Body before returning the error.

- [ ] [UT-301] Guard nil contexts in factory Chat.

Unlike Client.Chat, Factory.Chat assumes the caller passes a non-nil context and dereferences ctx.Err() unconditionally. Passing nil—which the client explicitly supports by falling back to context.Background()—will panic here, breaking callers that swap in a factory without changing their context handling.
