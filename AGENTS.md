# AGENTS.md

## tyemirov/utils

A collection of small Go helpers that can be shared between projects. See README.md for details

## Document Roles

- issues.md/NOTES.md: Read-only process playbook maintained by leads. Agents never edit it during implementation cycles.
- issues.md/ISSUES.md: Append-only log of newly discovered requests and changes. No instructive sections live here; each entry records what changed or what was discovered.
- issues.md/PLAN.md: Working plan for one concrete change/issue; ephemeral and replaced per change.

### Document Precedence

- `issues.md/POLICY.md` defines binding validation, error-handling, and “confident programming” rules.
- `AGENTS.md` (this file) defines repo-wide workflow, testing philosophy, and agent behavior; stack-specific AGENTS.* guides refine these rules for each technology.
- `issues.md/AGENTS.*.md` files never contradict `AGENTS.md` or `POLICY.md`; if guidance appears inconsistent, defer to `POLICY.md` first, then `AGENTS.md`, and treat the stack guide as a refinement.
- `issues.md/NOTES.md` is process-only and must not introduce rules that conflict with `POLICY.md` or any `AGENTS*.md` files.

### Issue Status Terms

- Resolved: Completed and verified; no further action.
- Unresolved: Needs decision and/or implementation.
- Blocked: Requires an external dependency or policy decision.

### Validation & Confidence Policy

All rules for validation, error handling, invariants, and “confident programming” (no defensive checks, edge-only validation, smart constructors, CI gates) are defined in POLICY.md. Treat that document as binding; this file does not restate them.

### Build & Test Commands

- Use the repository `Makefile` for local automation. Invoke `make test`, `make lint`, `make ci`, or other documented targets instead of running ad-hoc tool commands.
- `make test` runs the canonical test suite for the active stack.
- `make lint` enforces linting rules before code review.
- `make ci` mirrors the GitHub Actions workflow and should pass locally before opening a PR.

### Tooling Workflow (Tests, Lint, Format)

- For any change intended to land, agents MUST ensure that all required tooling for the relevant stack (tests, linters, and formatters as defined in `AGENTS*` and `POLICY.md`) passes cleanly on the branch before code is merged or released.
- `NOTES.md` defines the concrete workflow for humans (when and how to invoke specific commands such as `make test`, `make lint`, `make ci`, and formatter targets); agents should treat those steps as given but do not need to restate or modify them.

### Testing Philosophy

- Testing follows an **inverted test pyramid**: most coverage comes from high-value black-box integration and end-to-end tests; unit tests are optional and exist only when they add clear implementation guardrails.
- We **strive for 100% test coverage**, achieved primarily through integration/black-box suites whose scenarios are exhaustive enough to exercise all meaningful branches and error paths.
- For CLI and backend services, tests compile or run the real program/CLI entrypoints, capture exit codes and output (stdout/stderr, files, side effects), and assert against those observable results—not internal functions.
- For web/UI, tests run the app and backing web server, drive flows through the browser, and assert against the rendered page, DOM state, events, and other user-visible behavior.
- Unit tests are acceptable as **implementation guardrails**, but they are not product-level acceptance criteria, must not be the primary mechanism for achieving coverage, and may be removed when equivalent or stronger integration coverage exists.

## Tech Stack Guides

Stack-specific instructions now live in dedicated files. Apply the relevant guide alongside the shared policies above.

- Backend (Go): `issues.md/AGENTS.GO.md`
- Git and version control workflow: `issues.md/AGENTS.GIT.md`
